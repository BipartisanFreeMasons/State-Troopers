***[$] VA Budgeting : UPGRADES/PROMOTIONS for Law Enforcement --- (Questions & Answers)
     [#1.] (Q/A): What purpose does a promotion in Law-Enforcement Sector-Upgrade serve to the Veterans' Communities across the U.S.?
            A.) The main purpose for an upgrade within law enforcement in any state, is to ultimately live up to the title of "America's Finest" when it comes to the police force here at home, as well as when applied to the U.S. Army & troops of our military. This upgrade is much needed across the nation in all different states, beginning here in California. This upgrade to "TROOPER" opens many new doors of employment along with the 'title' or 'badge upgrade,' it will supply thousands of jobs for U.S. Citizens in all different states in all different areas of Law-Enforcement and Emergency Response-Units.

     [#2.] (Q/A): How will an upgrade in Law Enforcement in all states benefit the communities in all state-districts as far as serving the communities?
            A.) This is a sensitive subject for most because, most feel threatened by current police officers when they come into contact with one at any time. This is one gap I am hoping this policing change will register this stereotypical fear no more. There should be no reason to fear your local police officers, even if you are guilty of possessing drug or a misdimenor-crime, you should feel comfortable and safe in the hands of any law-enforcement officer. TROOPERS would be highly trained and well-educated in each of their unique positions of work, whether it's emergency-aid or K9 unit response.

     [#3.] (Q/A): Will this benefit public safety and citizen-relationships with local law-enforcement officers and all the individuals of the public?
            A.) TROOPER enstatement is one of the best community-strengthening benefits I can dream-up for the future, because of many different factor that come into play with law-enforcement. Personally, I feel the current system of police officers we have here in California are all lacking in high-grade training and equipment training as well as highly-upgraded pursuit-vehicles and higher-educated workforce needed to properly protect and serve, and here is where the Veterans' Community comes in handy for employment opportunities as well as for the public with proper testing and training.
